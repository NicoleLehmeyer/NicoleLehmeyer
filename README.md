# Nicole Lehmeyer

## **About Me:**

My name is **Nicole Lehmeyer**, and I am an **application specialist** working on the implementation and optimisation of healthcare billing and revenue collection systems, enhancing financial workflows and operational efficiency for healthcare organisations.

I am a graduate of the Common Core of **[42](https://www.42network.org/)** (BA. Software Development), an intensive and highly selective software engineering program known for its challenging, project-based curriculum (many of which can be found here).

I also have a background in human psychology and communication \(from my BA. Speech Pathology\) and have leveraged my mixed skillset in health, people and technology.


## Ultimately:

I am fascinated by the way society and systems evolve in alignment with technological advancements, particularly within the financial world, where digital solutions have democratised finance for the everyday individual. I would love to apply my skills here more one day!

## Side Quests:

Indoor bouldering. <br>
Surfing.<br>
Dance.<br>
**[Dev_Climb](https://devclimb.org/)** my business for new-wave networking - connecting STEM professionals and students in a bouldering gym. --> Nominated for 2026 APAC Enterprise Award!
